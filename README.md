## **dAy 1:**

- **wAkE uP**... or did I? The clock's hands seem to move backward. 🕰️
- **BrEaKfAsT**: toast? No, it was... something else. The taste lingers, unfamiliar. 🍞
- **mEeTiNg** with... someone. Their face is a blur, their voice an echo. 🤔

## **dAy 2:**

- **sTrAnGe DrEaMs** last night. Faces without names, places without time. 💤
- **FoUnD a NoTe** under my pillow. It said: "ThEy'Re WaTcHiNg YoU." The handwriting looks like mine. 👀
- **LuNcH**: soup? Or was it salad? The spoon feels heavy, the bowl deep. 🥗

## **dAy 3:**

- **LoSt In ThE cItY**. Streets twist and turn, buildings loom and shrink. 🏙️
- **mEt A sTrAnGeR**. He knew my name, but I didn't know his. 😨
- **dInNeR**: something cold. The chill seeps into my bones. 🥶

## **dAy 4:**

- **CaN't ReMeMbEr** what happened today. The hours slip through my fingers. 🧠
- **FoUnD a KeY** in my pocket. It doesn't fit any lock I know. 🔑
- **nIgHt**: shadows everywhere. They move when I blink. 🌑

## **dAy 5:**

- **wAkE uP**... or did I? The bed feels different, the room unfamiliar. 🕰️
- **BrEaKfAsT**: toast? No, it was... something else. The crumbs form patterns on the plate. 🍞
- **mEeTiNg** with... someone. Can't remember. Their words are lost in the fog. 🤔
